## 🔱 DrakoClient
My first real python application (very unstable and poop), it is a minecraft launcher with PvP mods to improve the experience.

## ⚙️ Installation
To execute this app, you will need python 3.11 (or newer) and the folowing modules :
1) os
2) customtkinter
3) configparser

## 🚀 Usage
Once theses prerequisite are done, just execute the file named "app.py"
